    <p>The final position of the robot does not have to match the picture, as long as the beeper pattern is correct.</p>
    <h4>Part 2</h4>
    <p>Open the <strong>Level_6</strong> tab and change line 4 from:</p>
<div class="code" markdown="1">
```java
boolean loadMultipleRobots = false;
```
</div>
    <p>to:</p>
<div class="code" markdown="1">
```java
boolean loadMultipleRobots = true;
```
</div>
    <p></p>
    
    <p>Each of the robots must use the same set of commands to create a checkerboard in their section.</p>
