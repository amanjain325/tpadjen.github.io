<div class="karel content">
  <h2>Start</h2>
    <p>Help Karel the robot clean up her world!</p>
    <img src="/public/img/karel/0/level_0-begin.png">
  <h2>Commands</h2>
  <p>Tell your robot how to complete this level by writing commands. Commands go in the <code>Robot</code> tab inside the <code>commands</code> method</p>

<div class="code" markdown="1">
```javascript
void commands() {
  // put your robot instructions here!!!

}
```
</div>

  <p>Here's a list of the commands you can use.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>move()</dt>
    <dd>Move the robot forward one square in her current direction.</dd>
    <dd class="caution">A wall must not be directly in front of the robot when moving.</dd>
    
    <dt>turnLeft()</dt>
    <dd>Turn the robot left 90 degrees.</dd>
    
    <dt>pickBeeper()</dt>
    <dd>Tell the robot to pick up a beeper from the world.</dd>
    <dd class="caution">A beeper must exist at the robot's current position.</dd>
    
    <dt>putBeeper()</dt>
    <dd>Tell the robot to put down a beeper at her current position.</dd>
    <dd class="caution">The robot must have beepers in her beeper bag.</dd>
    
    <dt>turnOff()</dt>
    <dd>Stop running commands and print the results.</dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Errors</h2>
    <p>If you break the rules of a command, your robot will shut itself down. For example, this set of commands:</p>
    
<div class="code" markdown="1">
```javascript
void commands() {
  move();
  move();
  move();
}
```
</div>
    <p>will cause your robot to shutdown because it may not walk through walls. Here is what that will look like in the world:</p>
    <img src="/public/img/karel/0/level_0-error.png">
    <p>and in the console:</p>

<div class="code" markdown="1">
```shell
Press space to start
Karel is facing East  at [1, 1] with 0 beepers.
Karel is facing East  at [2, 1] with 0 beepers.
Karel is facing East  at [3, 1] with 0 beepers.
Karel !!!Error!!! Tried to walk through a wall!
```

  <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>This is what it should look like when you have successfully completed the level.</p>
    <img src="/public/img/karel/0/level_0-end.png">
  <div class="results">
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>When you <code>turnOff</code> your robot, it will print information to the console. Compare yours to a typical solution below. If you used a lot more moves or turns, re-think the problem and try to create a more efficient solution.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Moves</td>
        <td>19</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Turns</td>
        <td>16</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Puts</td>
        <td>5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Picks</td>
        <td>5</td>
      </tr>
