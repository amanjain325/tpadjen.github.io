2. Iteratively design, implement, and test your program
3. Use several integrated mathematical and logical concepts
4. Implement an algorithm that incorporates or utilizes other algorithms, and integrates the  mathematical and logical concepts described above
5. Develop and use abstractions that help manage the complexity of the program (e.g., procedures, abstractions provided by the chosen language, APIs)
